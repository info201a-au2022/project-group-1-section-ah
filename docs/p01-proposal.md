### Abstract
### Keywords: 
Population, Asia, Increase, Decrease, Change
### Introduction:
Population has always been an issue for many Asian countries. For example, India and China always had their issues with a large growing population compared to Japan that has a major problem with their decreasing population. This project is set to cover all of the population change that has happened throughout all 51 countries that are in Asia and why they are experiencing a growth or decline. Having this type of information is important to study and understand all issues that some Asian countries are having in their respective countries. So this project should show each country's population throughout the years, what countries have grown or declined, why they have either grown or declined, and finally the UN’s population expectancy in the future years.
