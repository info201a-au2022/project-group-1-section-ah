### **Abstract**
We are concerned with both the growing and declining population of Asia. Without a proper balance in the birth and death rates, multiple nations could potentially face large issues in the near future. To adress this concern, we plan to gather the data of population, birthrate, and deathrate across all nations in Asia, then generate a visual representation to emphasize the sevierity.

### **Introduction**
Population has always been an issue for many Asian countries. For example, India and China always had their issues with a large growing population compared to Japan that has a major problem with their decreasing population. This project is set to cover all of the population change that has happened throughout all 51 countries that are in Asia and why they are experiencing a growth or decline. Having this type of information is important to study and understand all issues that some Asian countries are having in their respective countries. So this project should show each country's population throughout the years, what countries have grown or declined, why they have either grown or declined, and finally the UN’s population expectancy in the future years.

### **Problem Domain**
### **Research Questions**
1. Which countries are facing the most issues currently or in the near future from population increase/decrease? This is important because the data from thouse countries could set precedents for similar issues in the future.
2. What are common factors of nations that have the highest birth/death rate incline/decline? Which factors seem to have the biggest impact? This is important to understand the source of the issue, and the areas to focus on when resolving the issue.
3. Is there a general trend among all nations? If so, what are the trends, and if not, what is causing all the difference? This question will allow us to categorize and group up countries into some sections and
