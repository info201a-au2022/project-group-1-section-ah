## Dynamic Paragraph

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
library(maps)
library(cowplot)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```


```{r}
# Sourcing charts here
source("../source/map_chart.R")
source("../source/chart2.R")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots


## Map Chart (2021 only)
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
map1s
happy_map
```

##### Short summary
The two map charts are suppose to show how one the population throughout all the Asian countries and additionally the happiness index across all the Asian countries. The first one is obvious on why it is important mainly because of the fact that it is important to document the population in 2021 and the happiness index can also be a way to indentify why a certain country has more people in it than not.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
